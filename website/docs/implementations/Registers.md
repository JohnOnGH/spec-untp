## Implementation Register

Summary list of identity registers (of products, facilities, locations, legal entities) that have implemented or plan to implement UNTP specifications to support their registered members with the tools to prove their identifier ownership and to make the identifier resolvable as a signpost to rich and verifiable sustainability data about the registered product or facility. 

Register types are

* Organisation - for example national business registers
* Facility - physical location or land parcel registers
* Product - registers of trade-able products (eg GS1 barcodes)
* Logistics - registers of logistics carriers or consignments.
