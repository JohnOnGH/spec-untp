## For Buyers and Suppliers in the Value Chain

Implementation guidance is broken into three phases (crawl, walk, run) that provide a mecahnism to safely transition from low cost pilots to full scale production implementations with decision points (proceed, pivot, pause) at each stage gate.  

|Phase|Focus|Outcome|
|--|--|--|
|Discovery|Familiarisation with UNTP. Assessment of scope and value. |Manually created trial digital credentials exchanged with a small number of trading partners. Business case for Alpha phase ready for decision.|
|Aplha|Validation of integration cost & complexity. Validation of scope and value|Automated creation and verification of digital credentials from natural business systems (test environments). Ready to scale. Go/NoGo decision ready |
|Beta|Managed expansion to full scale implementation for all products, facilites, and partners|Realisation and reporting of ongoing value|

|--|--|--|
|1|Map cost & benefit categories using [business case template](../business-case/index.md) |Raw case for implementation|
|2|Map sustainability categories|Prioritised sustainability criteria scope|
|3|Map value chain scope|Pilot product and participant scope|
|4|Create identities|Got usable DIDs|
|5|Create sample DPPs using reference implementaiton|Got a realistic DPP for one product|
|6|Verify supplier DPPs|Upstream supply visibility|
|7|Map supplier DPPs to corporate disclosures|Prove scope 3 feasibility|
|8|Create transformation event|Supplier DPP is linked to my DPP|
|9|Add conformity credential|Add 3rd party verificaiton to my DPP|
|10|Create & publish links|Made my DPP discoverable|
|11|Encrypt one supplier DPP & create secure link|Prove that confidential information can be selectively disclosed|
