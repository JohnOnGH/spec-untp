However, just as expecting your customers and suppliers to create accounts at your bank so that you can pay them is not rational or practical (that\'s why inter-bank payment standards exist), so the adoption of all actors in value chains to one platform is also not feasible or scalable.

Some are specific to particular commodities, jurisdictions, or ESG criteria and some cover multiple dimensions. There is very significant overlap between them and very little formal mutual recognition. The consequence is that it becomes very challenging for supply chain actors that sell to multiple export markets to know which criteria matter and how to demonstrate compliance. There is a risk that too much of the available ESG incentive is spent on demonstrating compliance and too little is left for implementing more sustainable practices. The UNTP does not add to the complexity by defining more ESG standards.
