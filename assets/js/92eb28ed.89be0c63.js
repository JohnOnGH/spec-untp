Furthermore, to facilitate scalable uptake of digital credentials, the UNTP avoids any need for system-to-system data exchange by including security and human readability into each digital credential. Given any identifier for any product, represented with any data carrier, the UNTP ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"/spec-untp/docs/specification/IdentityResolver"},"Identity Resolver")," specification provides a means to discover the Digital Product Passport and verify it, irrespective of whether the verifier is a human or a machine.
