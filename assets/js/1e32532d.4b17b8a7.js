There are not only obvious interoperability benefits from industry wide adoption but also cost benefits. For example, it is often the case that a small number of commercial software platforms are commonly used by larger numbers of businesses in a given industry and jurisdiction. So a software vendor that implements UNTP once will benefit all it's customers. Additionally there are often a few standards and a few certifiers that are common to an industry and country. Also, there is very often one or more existing member associations that represent most of the actors in a given industry and country. Finally, when a large community is willing to act together, there will often be financial incentives from governments and/or development banks that can assist with initial funding.
