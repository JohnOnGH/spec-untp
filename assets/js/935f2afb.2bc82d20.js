In some cases the commercial incentive is regulatory compliance. But few economies (The European Union is a notable exception) have current or emerging regulation that demands digital product passports for products sole or manufactured in their economy. However, there is much wider regulatory enforcement of annual corporate sustainability disclosures. But without sustainability data from supply chains at product level, there is no easy way for corporates to accurately meet their annual disclosure obligations. Worse, without product level data from suppliers, there is no way at all for corporates to select supply in such a way that they can demonstrate year-on-year improvements to sustainability performance. On top of the disclosure obligation, most corporates are very concerned about reputational risk associates with un-sustainable behaviour from their upstream suppliers. Furthermore, the financial sector is increasingly able and willing to provide improved financial terms for trade finance or investment capital to businesses with string sustainability credentials. All these incentives drive behaviour and value but there is still some effort needed for each implementer to make a positive business case for change. UNTP offers some tools to determine the value that can inform a positive case for change.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"business-case/ValueAssessmentFramework":{"id":"business-case/ValueAssessmentFramework","title":"Value Assessment Framework","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"design-patterns/Counterfeiting":{"id":"design-patterns/Counterfeiting","title":"Anti-Counterfeiting","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"design-patterns/DataCarriers":{"id":"design-patterns/DataCarriers","title":"Data Carriers","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"design-patterns/index":{"id":"design-patterns/index","title":"Best Practices","description":"Design patterns are non-normative but provide best practice guidance for UNTP implementers.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"design-patterns/MassBalance":{"id":"design-patterns/MassBalance","title":"Mass Balance","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"design-patterns/Rules":{"id":"design-patterns/Rules","title":"ESG Rules","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"design-patterns/TrustGraphs":{"id":"design-patterns/TrustGraphs","title":"Transparency Graphs","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"extensions/ExtensionsMethodology":{"id":"extensions/ExtensionsMethodology","title":"Extensions Methodology","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"extensions/ExtensionsRegister":{"id":"extensions/ExtensionsRegister","title":"Extensions Register","description":"Extensions Register","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"extensions/index":{"id":"extensions/index","title":"Extensions Register","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"implementations/Certifiers":{"id":"implementations/Certifiers","title":"Certifiers","description":"Implementation Register","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"implementations/index":{"id":"implementations/index","title":"Implementations Register","description":"Implementation Registers","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"implementations/Industry":{"id":"implementations/Industry","title":"Industry","description":"Implementation Register","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"implementations/Registers":{"id":"implementations/Registers","title":"Registers","description":"Implementation Register","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"implementations/Regulators":{"id":"implementations/Regulators","title":"Regulators","description":"Implementation Register","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"implementations/Software":{"id":"implementations/Software","title":"Software Solutions","description":"Please refer to Implementation Register for general information about the purpose, scope, and process of registering UNTP implementations.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"specification/Architecture":{"id":"specification/Architecture","title":"Architecture","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"specification/ConformityCredential":{"id":"specification/ConformityCredential","title":"Conformity Credential","description":"Artifacts","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"specification/DecentralisedAccessControl":{"id":"specification/DecentralisedAccessControl","title":"Decentralised Access Control","description":"There is a balance between the demands of transparency (more supply chain visibility means it\'s harder to hide greenwshing) and confidentiality (share too much data and you risk expososing commercial secrets). A key UNTP principle is that every supply chain actor should be able to choose their own balance between transparency and confidentiality. To achieve this, UNTP defines six data confidentiality patterns with different degrees of data protection so that they can be appropriately combined to meet the confidentiality goals of each party. This includes the ability to selectively redact data from credentials received from upstream suppliers before passing them on to downstream buyers - without affecting the cryptographic integrity of the data.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"specification/DigitalFacilityRecord":{"id":"specification/DigitalFacilityRecord","title":"Digital Facility Profile","description":"Artifacts","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"specification/DigitalIdentityAnchor":{"id":"specification/DigitalIdentityAnchor","title":"Digital Identity Anchor","description":"Artifacts","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"specification/DigitalProductPassport":{"id":"specification/DigitalProductPassport","title":"Digital Product Passport","description":"Artifacts","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"specification/DigitalTraceabilityEvents":{"id":"specification/DigitalTraceabilityEvents","title":"Digital Traceability Events","description":"Artifacts","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"specification/IdentityResolver":{"id":"specification/IdentityResolver","title":"Identity Resolver","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"specification/index":{"id":"specification/index","title":"Specification","description":"The specification is the heart of UNTP.

A VC is a portable digital version of everyday credentials like education certificates, permits, licenses, registrations, and so on. VCs are digitally signed by the issuing party and are tamper evident, privacy preserving, revocable, and digitally verifiable. The UN has previously assessed this standard and has recommended its use for a variety of cross border trade use cases in a recent white paper. VCs are inherently decentralized and so are an excellent fit for UNTP which recommends that passports, credentials, and traceability events are all issued as W3C VCs. A related W3C standard called Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) provides a mechanism to manage the cryptographic keys used by verifiable credentials and also to link multiple credentials into verifiable trust graphs. DIDs are not the same as the business / product / location identifiers maintained by authoritative agencies - but can be linked to them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tools-and-support/HelpAndSupport":{"id":"tools-and-support/HelpAndSupport","title":"Help and support","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tools-and-support/ImplementationPlans":{"id":"tools-and-support/ImplementationPlans","title":"Implementation Plans","description":"For Buyers and Suppliers in the Value Chain","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tools-and-support/index":{"id":"tools-and-support/index","title":"Implementation Guidance","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tools-and-support/ReferenceImplementation":{"id":"tools-and-support/ReferenceImplementation","title":"Reference Implementation","description":"The following tools make up a reference implementation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tools-and-support/TestService":{"id":"tools-and-support/TestService","title":"Test Services","description":"There is a 3 tier testing architecture to help implementors ensure that they are issuing UNTP interoperable digital product passports.
